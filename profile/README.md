## About Us

Every year, churches spend hundreds of millions of dollars on software needed to run a church effectively. We believe by working together the Church can provide this software for free, and free up donor funds to more directly support ministry efforts.

ChurchApps provides **free**, **open-source** technology solutions for churches, helping them manage operations, engage congregations, and access educational resources without the expense. Our offerings include church management software, presentation software, and curriculum — all funded by donations and designed to support the Church's mission.
